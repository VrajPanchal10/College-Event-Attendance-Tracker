- **Faculty** can create events, manage capacity, and mark attendance with a single click.
- **Students** can discover upcoming events, register instantly, and track their participation history.

cd "College Event Attendance Tracker"
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```

Create a `.env` file in the `Backend/` root and add your configuration:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/cvm_event_tracker
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
JWT_EXPIRE=1d
```

Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev    # For development (auto-restarts)
# OR
npm start      # For production
```
*The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`*

### 3. Frontend Setup
The frontend is built with pure Vanilla JS and HTML. No build step is required!
